    </string>
    <string name="treatment_guide">The most effective depression treatment varies from person to person. It is important to talk to your doctor or a mental health professional about the best treatment for you. For some, depression may be caused by an underlying medical condition such as hypothyroidism. For most people, psychotherapy and/or antidepressants are effective methods of treatment. Lifestyle changes are also an important element of recovery. Keep in mind that there are no instant cures, and it might take some time and commitment to recover from depression.</string>
    <string name="psychotherapy">Psychotherapy</string>
    <string name="psychotherapy_treatment">Psychotherapy - or "talk therapy" - is an effective treatment for clinical depression and is often the first form of treatment recommended for depression. During psychotherapy, you talk to a licensed and trained mental health professional who helps you work through depression in various ways. This approach teaches you the skills to deal with your depression and help prevent future occurrences of depression as well. Therapy can be given in a variety of formats including individual to find a therapist that you can connect with and trust. In addition, there are several different approaches to therapy.

    <string name="antidepressants">Antidepressants</string>
    <string name="antidepressant_treatment">Antidepressant treatment is also effective for treating clinical depression. It is more effective for severe cases of depression, and is commonly combined with psychotherapy for an even greater effect. There are many classes of antidepressants, such as SSRIs, SNRIs, or tricyclic antidepressants.

    <string name="lack_sunlight_explain">Lack of sunlight can worsen depression or increase the chances of getting depression. If not given enough light exposure, the body\'s biological rhythm can go out of balance, affecting things such as energy, sleep, appetite, and hormones. Therefore, disrupting these regular body rhythms can be bad for mood and trigger depression.</string>
    <string name="lack_sunlight_explain2">Aim for at least 15 minutes of sunshine a day to keep mood and biological rhythms is sync. For wintertime places with little sun, try getting a <a href='http://amzn.to/2pZ1Pip'>light therapy box</a></string>
    <string name="supportive_relationships"><u>Supportive Relationships</u></string>
    <string name="supportive_relationships_guide">Relationships matter. Humans are social creatures, and people who lack a supportive network have a greater risk of becoming depression. Whether preventing depression, overcoming depression, or simply being a happier person, having quality and trusting relationships is an important element of living. When one is in a depressed state, isolation and loneliness can be all the more harmful.</string>
    <string name="supportive_relationships_contain">
        <li>Although it may seem intimidating or intrusive, approach trusted friends and family, preferably face to face, and discuss one\'s depression. Ask for support or help. Reaching out is not a sign of weakness, nor should it be considered a burden to others.</li>\n\n
        <li>Try to keep us with social interactions and activities even if it feels challenging or uncomfortable.</li>\n\n
        <li>Joining a support group for depression can reduce feelings of loneliness and isolation. Support groups can connect people with others who share similar experiences. One can give and receive advice on how to cope with depression, share stories, and encourage one another in a shared space.</li>
    </string>
    <string name="group_therapy"><u>Group Therapy</u></string>
    <string name="group_therapy_detail">A form of depression treatment known as group therapy may be helpful. Such sessions provide an outlet for depressed persons to share their problems, which in itself a powerful healing tool, as well as a platform for mutual learning from each other\'s experiences. Listening to others\' issues helps put one\'s own problems in perspective too.</string>
    <string name="exercise_guide_1">Regular exercise has been shown to reduce stress, ward off anxiety and feelings of depression, boost self-esteem, and improve sleep. Exercise can change the brain by increasing the activity level of key chemicals such as dopamine and serotonin as well as key growth hormones. These brain chemicals can then increase endorphins and reduce stress, leading to improvements in depression symptoms. Exercise can even be as effective as antidepressants at increasing energy and mood while decreasing feelings of fatigue.</string>
    <string name="exercise_include">
        Moderate physical activity produces risk-free benefits for people with depression or without depression. Some examples of moderate exercise include:\n
        <li>Biking</li>\n
        <li>Dancing</li>\n
        <li>Gardening</li>\n
        <li>Housework, especially sweeping, mopping, or vacuuming</li>\n
        <li>Jogging at a moderate pace</li>\n
        <li>Low-impact aerobics</li>\n
        <li>Playing tennis</li>\n
        <li>Swimming</li>\n
        <li>Walking</li>\n
        <li>Yard work, especially mowing or raking</li>\n
        <li>Yoga</li>
    </string>
    <string name="key_start_exercise">The key is to start small and pick enjoyable activities so that one is more likely to keep up with them. To stay motivated, try exercising with supportive group, close friend, or partner. In doing so one can benefit from both physical activity and social support.</string>
    <string name="exercise_link">http://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/depression/in-depth/depression-and-exercise/art-20046495</string>
    <string name="nutrition_detail">Getting proper nutrition is important for recovering from depression, especially because depression can affect appetite. It has been shown that low levels of the nutrients zinc, Vitamin B6, Vitamin B12, omega-3 fatty acids, and folate can lead to an increased risk of depression. Omega-3 fatty acids, in particular, have been shown to be extremely beneficial in keeping the brain functioning properly and decreasing the risk for depression and other forms of mental illnesses.</string>
    <string name="nutrition_contains">
        In addition, people who are clinically depressed often do not eat a balanced diet. Thus, poor nutrition leads to depressive symptoms and depressive symptoms lead to poorer nutrition, resulting in an unhealthy cycle. Tip for having a healthy and mood-boosting diet includes:\n
        <li>Dietary omega-3 fatty acids. Omega-3 fatty acids are found in fish, nuts, seeds, and leafy vegetables. Try taking omega-3 supplements as well.</li>\n
        <li>B vitamins. Lack of B vitamins such as folic acid and Vitamin B-12 can increase risk for depression. Taking vitamin supplements or eating foods such as citrus fruits, leafy greens, chicken, and eggs will increase B vitamin intake.</li>\n
        <li>Cut down on sugar and refine carbs such as candy and french fries. These "feel good" and "quick fix" foods can often lead to a crash in mood and energy.</li>\n
        <li>Eat balanced meals. Eating well-rounded meals from all the food groups makes for balanced nutrition and can improve health and mood.</li>\n
        <li>Do not skip meals. Skipping meals or going too long between meals can increase irritability or tiredness.</li>

    <string name="sleep_detail">
        People with depression commonly experience disturbed sleep patterns, but depression can affect sleep in a variety of ways. Research shows that people with insomnia have a ten times higher risk of developing depression, so it is important to ensure a good night\'s sleep every night. Ensuring the quality and quantity of sleep can not only improve mood and symptoms of depression, but can also help stave off things that can trigger a depressive episode. Some sleep hygiene tips includes:\n
        <li>Manage your exposure to light. The key to better sleep hygiene is managing your exposure to light. Your brain depends on the level of ambient light or darkness to manage your daily rhythms. Before bedtime, limit your exposure to light as much as possible and while sleeping.</li>\n
        <li>Exercise. Make sure to get regular exercise and spend some time outdoors in the sunlight every day. This is a good way to set your biologic clock, and it helps maintain a regular sleep-wake cycle. However, try to exercise at least three hours before bed or else the stress hormones released by exercising might keep you up.</li>\n
        <li>Skip the nap. Avoid afternoon naps, which can lead to nighttime insomnia.</li>\n
        <li>Limit caffeine and alcohol, especially later in the day. Caffeine is a stimulant and can keep you wide awake, while alcohol can disrupt sleep quality. Alcohol before bedtime will interfere with sleep and it may help you fall asleep, but you are less likely to sleep through the night.</li>\n
        <li>Get up if you can't sleep. Don't waste time lying in bed looking at your clock. If you find yourself lying awake, the best thing is to get up and do something relaxing until you feel tired.</li>\n
        <li>Shut off the TV and the phone. Avoid watching television late at night. Most shows in the evening are too stimulating and do not promote good sleep. It's better to read a book or do a relaxing activity in the hours before bed. If you must use your phone, download applications that dim the screen down to very dim levels such as 'Screen Filter.'</li>\n
        <li>Turn your bedroom into a sleep-inducing environment. Use your bedroom primarily for sleep and try your best to make it a quiet, dark, and cool environment.</li>\n
        <li>Establish a soothing pre-sleep routine and keep a consistent sleep schedule. Ease your transition from wake time to sleep time with an hour or so of relaxing activities.
